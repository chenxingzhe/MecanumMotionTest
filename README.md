This project uses visual odormeter to control robot's movement.
We use a very simple method to get robot's  position,a red label and a blue labe by
using two labels' world position and transformation of world ,camera,image coordinate.
This part of code is in the calclandmark.cpp.
And the code to record visual odormeter and using the record to navigate is in the MecanumMotion.cpp.
